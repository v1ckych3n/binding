                <p><strong>WORDS AS MATERIALS</strong></p>

                <p>
                    I had originally started out with <em>Words as Materials</em> by Nicole Fenton which gives a scope into how communication as a whole can alter and affect the way we communicate with either ourself and expanding outwards towards the public and their perception of what we are trying to communicate. In a way, communication is an arc or "continuum" of writing since it is a form of written communication. There are some instances within the reading where I understand where the author is coming from by honing in on the idea that writers are also designers. In a way, it is true because between designers and writers, the only difference that separate the two is the material that is being used. Designers have a ranged of materials that can range from physical medium to digital medium to create their vision/message, whereas writers would use words as to create their product, their idea, their voice.
