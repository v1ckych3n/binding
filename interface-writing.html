                <p>The web and the world are full of instructions. Everywhere you go, signs and people are telling you what to do.</p>

                <p>Walk. Don't walk.</p>

                <p>Follow me please. Stop. Hang on. Please stand clear.</p>

                <p>Fasten your seatbelt. Read this.</p>

                <p>Do this.</p>

                <p>Take this. Buy this. Find us on Facebook. Please enter your name.</p>

                <p>You get the idea. So bossy.</p>

                <p>Think about the app you're building right now.</p>

                <p>What actions can people take? What are you asking them to do? What are you allowing them to do? What are the rules and dead-ends? What sort of language do you use to guide people?</p>

                <p>Whatever you're building, you need to think about the content in the database and the instructions around it. I call those things <em>interface writing</em>. Some people call them <em>microcopy</em> since they're usually short.</p>

                <h2>Interface writing</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>buttons</li>
                    <li>notifications</li>
                    <li>errors and alerts</li>
                    <li>forms</li>
                    <li>in-app disclosures</li>
                    <li>links</li>
                    <li>navigation</li>
                    <li>product tours</li>
                    <li>setting names</li>
                    <li>tooltips</li>
                    <li>transactional emails</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    From navigation links and buttons to product tours, forms, and error messagesâ€“every string in your database is an instruction. These are your signposts, and they grab your reader's attention.

                    As developers and writers, you have a lot of power. The user wants something. Maybe it's information, an easier way of doing things, chocolate chip cookies, or hilarious cat videos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With clear instructions and a warm tone, you can help them find what they need quickly without having to ask anyone for help.

                    Let me tell you a story. This is my dad. He's a test engineer. He works on semiconductors and develops tests for parts and batteries. So growing up, we always had computers around the house and the latest in PC technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We used to have this program called Dr. Sbaitso, which you may have heard of. It was a computerized psychologist slash artifical intelligence program designed to show off sound cards, but I thought it was a game and used to play with it for hours.

                    This is what it looked like. A typical, boring DOS interface.
