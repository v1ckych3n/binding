                <p>The web and the world are full of instructions. Everywhere you go, signs and people are telling you what to do.</p>

                <p>Walk. Don't walk.</p>

                <p>Follow me please. Stop. Hang on. Please stand clear.</p>

                <p>Fasten your seatbelt. Read this.</p>

                <p>Do this.</p>

                <p>Take this. Buy this. Find us on Facebook. Please enter your name.</p>

                <p>You get the idea. So bossy.</p>

                <p>Think about the app you're building right now.</p>

                <p>What actions can people take? What are you asking them to do? What are you allowing them to do? What are the rules and dead-ends? What sort of language do you use to guide people?</p>

                <p>Whatever you're building, you need to think about the content in the database and the instructions around it. I call those things <em>interface writing</em>. Some people call them <em>microcopy</em> since they're usually short.</p>

                <p>
                    From navigation links and buttons to product tours, forms, and error messagesâ€“every string in your database is an instruction. These are your signposts, and they grab your reader's attention.
